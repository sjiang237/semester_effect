The Learning and Transfer Lab collects data from students enrolled in PSYCH 202 (Introduction to Psychology) through surveys taken for extra credit. These surveys, conducted via Qualtrics from Spring 2018 to Fall 2023, assess various cognitive skills and personality traits, including Matrices tests, Big Five Personality Questions, Grit Scale, Mindset Questionnaire, and ADHD assessments. Students complete the surveys at different points throughout the semester, providing a unique dataset that spans multiple semesters and academic terms.
The aim of this project is to analyze the variation in students' cognitive and personality scores across different times during the semester and across different semesters. Specifically, we seek to determine whether scores exhibit systematic trends based on when students complete the survey, if these trends differ between semesters, particularly during the pandemic period, and if seasonal factors play a role in these trends. By leveraging linear regression models, we have begun identifying key patterns in the data. Going forward, the project will incorporate machine learning techniques to enhance predictive accuracy and to identify more complex relationships among the data.
The goal is to provide insights into the temporal and contextual dynamics of student performance in cognitive and personality tasks, Specifically, we aim to address two key questions:
1)	Is there an advantage to recruiting participants at different times during the semester? This could help optimize the timing of data collection for more accurate assessments.
2)	If there is a robust effect of when participants complete the surveys on their cognitive performance, particularly in variables such as fluid intelligence and ADHD, it may be beneficial to control this timing in future studies. By regressing out the influence of timing, researchers can better assess dependent variables (DVs) that are sensitive to changes throughout the semester.
