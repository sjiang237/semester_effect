The Learning and Transfer Lab collects data from students enrolled in PSYCH 202 (Introduction to Psychology) through surveys taken for extra credit. My main survey dataset, conducted via Qualtrics from Spring 2018 to Fall 2023, assess various cognitive skills and personality traits, including Matrices tests, Big Five Personality Questions, Grit Scale, Mindset Questionnaire, and ADHD assessments. Students complete the surveys at different points throughout the semester, providing a unique dataset that spans multiple semesters and academic terms.

The aim of this project is to analyze whether the individual differences in Cognitive Abilities(fluid intelligence), Personality, ADHD (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder) Diagnosis affect their participation timing within the semester of psychological experiment.

Specifically, we seek to replicate the results of personality differences on different experiment participation timing and determine Clinical Measure ADHD diagnosis would affect participation timing. We want to assess the relative importance of these psychometrics measure differences effect in predicting participation timing but also the magnitude of their effect in participation timing. 

The Motivation of the Research includes: 
1)	Is there an advantage to recruiting participants at different times during the semester? This could help optimize the timing of data collection for more accurate assessments.

2)	Implications for Research Validity: Identifying patterns in participation timing cna help researchers understand potential biases in sample characteristics, which may affect the generalizability of findings.
