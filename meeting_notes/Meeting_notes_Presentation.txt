1. Have consistent color for each dataset 
2. Check for typos for the axis label! 
3. Swap the x-axis and y-axis for correlation plot 
4. Have all table of predictors in the same order! 
5. Show only the significant results of correlation (in this case ew can get rid of the openness!) 
6. Do another mediation pathway (grit--conscientiousness--days), find theoretical justification for them! 
7. Highlight what you want the audience to see! 
8. Put the comparative table of three datasets into one table
