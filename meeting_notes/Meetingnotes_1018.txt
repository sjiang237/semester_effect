1. Multivariate approach from advisor 
2. Ask about the best practice for clustering(pca, svm, k-means..)
3. Ask Ezgi about how to average the personality score 
4. Trying machine learning model (i.e. Random Forest) 
5. Ask advisor does it make sense to log transform the time variable
6. Start the powerpoint for presentation (start with dataset description, research question, methods...)
7. have the correlation plots and semester_type facet graphs; put them online
 
What to do next: 
1. based on the decision tree, split the data from fall and spring, and do analysis on them separately, looking at the interaction effect before splitting them
2. Thinking about quantile split of the data 
3. New mediation model: 
X= days M = conscientious Y = hit_rate
