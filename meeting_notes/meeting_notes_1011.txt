meeting note
What to accomplish before next meeting:
1) Reach out to Zach about the clean_ac_2021_wmgf; it is not uploaded into the shared folder 
2) Have the visualizations for
- big five for Clean_2021_EY_FYP
- Matrices Hit Rate for Clean_2022_LA_Patterns_FYP and clean_ac_2021_wmgf_raw
- Every test score for Postsurvey
3) Bindrows of the three datasets (Not pretty sure about how to do it)
4) Mediation test for the post survey 
5) Trying different clustering method for post survey 
6) Running Machine Learning Random Forest for example for the post survey (remove the rows where we do not have matrices tests score)
